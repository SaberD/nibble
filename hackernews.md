Hi HN.
I built Nibble, a local network scanner I always wanted because I kept forgetting the quickest way to find devices and services on my LAN or VPN that I needed to SSH or log into. It focuses on speed and ease of use.
It scans common ports, grabs service banners, and identifies hardware vendors in a clean terminal UI.
It’s open source and MIT Licensed, it's available on brew, npm and pip.
I’d love for you to try it out
